LIN3046 Group Report: Female Discourse Research
===========================

# Introduction
The study of female discourse is an important field of study that investigates the distinct language patterns, communication styles, and social dynamics that develop during discussions and interactions between women.  This research aims to better understand the effects language usage that female use, power relations, and the development of female identity and experience. Female discourse studies focuses on the ways in which women use language to negotiate difficult social and professional situations. This might entail looking at how women express themselves, develop rapport, and negotiate relationships using methods like indirectness, hedging, and collaborative communication. Scholars are also interested in studying how age, ethnicity, class, and cultural background interact with gender to influence women's communicating habits.

Another major topic of study is the function of female speech in the development and expression of feminine identity. Researchers may look at how women use language to reject or comply to gender stereotypes, build in-group alliances, and challenge patriarchal hierarchies. The study of female narratives, personal storytelling, and the language of female-dominated areas can provide light on women's lived experiences.

Key research concerns in female discourse include understanding how women utilise language to manage power dynamics, negotiate relationships, and express their agency in varied contexts?

1. What role does female discourse play in the creation, expression, and possible alteration of feminine identity and experience?
2. How do women's language patterns and communication practices alter throughout time, and
3. what do these changes imply about larger social transformations in gender norms and power dynamics?

By delving into these and other research concerns, female discourse can help us gain a better understanding of the subtle and multifaceted ways that gender influences language usage and social interaction.

## Descriptive Data
The source of our data mainly came from YouTube videos such as vlogs or podcast narrated by girls.

## Research Question(s) or problem addressed

According to Lakoff (1975), there are nine women’s language features: lexical hedges or fillers, tag question, empty adjectives, precise color terms, intensifiers, hypercorrect grammar, superpolite forms, avoidance of strong swear words, and emphatic stress, which attract widely attention of linguistic and gender scholars. 
Focusing on the three features "fillers", "tag questions" and "intensifiers", the aim of this project is to investigate and analyze the discourse features exhibited in the speech of women, with a particular focus on Emma Chamberlain's speaking style on YouTube. By examining her communication patterns and linguistic choices, we seek to gain insights into the unique characteristics and dynamics of female discourse.

  ### a.Description of the scope and the rationale of the project
  
  The scope of this project extends beyond the individual analysis of women speech. The vlogs, podcast, monologue from different YouTubers are collected. They serve as representative examples, allowing us to explore and understand broader patterns and tendencies in women's speech features.
  
  ### b.Potential use cases and future development
  
  Understanding female discourse features has implications across various domains, including linguistics, gender studies, media analysis, and communication research. By uncovering the distinctive linguistic markers and discourse strategies employed by women like Emma Chamberlain, we can gain insights into the dynamics of gendered communication and contribute to the development of more inclusive and equitable linguistic practices.

This research has the potential to inform communication training programs, public speaking courses, and media production practices, enabling individuals and organizations to better understand and utilize effective communication strategies while respecting diverse discourse styles. Furthermore, the findings from this project can serve as a foundation for future research on female discourse features, providing a basis for comparative studies and expanding our understanding of gendered communication dynamics.

### c.Relevant licensing issues and ethical concerns

  Throughout this project, we are committed to upholding ethical standards and ensuring compliance with relevant licensing requirements. Any data collected or analyzed from Emma Chamberlain's YouTube videos will be done so within the boundaries of fair use and the platform's terms of service. We respect the privacy and intellectual property rights of content creators and will handle the data collected with utmost care and confidentiality. Furthermore, any insights or findings resulting from this research will be presented in an ethical manner, with proper acknowledgement and citation of the sources.

# Dataset

We gathered information for our data collection procedure, primarily through podcasts and vlogs on YouTube. Merely the audio content transcriptions were the focus of our work. We separated the transcriptions into discrete time intervals or segments in order to efficiently organise the data.

In particular, we looked at female YouTubers who are native English speakers, preferably those with American and British accents. The idea was to record conversations and exchanges about female communication styles. We wanted to generate a dataset that reflected the language patterns, as well as the unique ways that girls express themselves, by concentrating on these particular speakers.

We utilised annotations to strengthen the dataset's quality. In order to add precise tags or labels which denote specific features or aspects inside the audio data, annotations were used. These annotations covered a wide range of topics, such as speech traits and the classification of particular accents, like British or American. Our goal in adding annotations was to add more levels of detail that would be useful for examinations, analysis, and the creation of tools that make good use of the dataset.

## Segmentation

Segmentation was an essential stage in our thorough data collection procedure that helped us break down the transcriptions into more manageable, relevant chunks. We used a variety of strategies and a combination of techniques since we understood how important segmentation was to efficiently organising and analysing the audio data. This allowed us to guarantee thorough segmentation based on specific needs.

The overall length of every section was one of the factors we took into account when segmenting the data. We attempted to maintain the best possible readability and manageability by keeping each section concise. For example, we established a rule that said no more than ten words may be in a line. Following this recommendation allowed us to produce easily assimilated portions that made the transcription content analysis and comprehension process flow more smoothly.

## Metadata

We focused in particular on collecting data from well-known female YouTubers who have made a substantial impact on the YouTube community throughout the data collection process. A significant number of people know these individuals because they provide interesting content, typically in the form of vlogs and podcasts that are lifestyle videos. By sharing details of their everyday lives in an open and transparent manner across these platforms, these renowned YouTubers provide viewers with insight into their daily lives and conversations about a range of topics.

These female YouTubers were specifically chosen because of their enormous influence and popularity, especially among Gen Z. They are the perfect candidates for our research on how girls communicate because of their widely shared material and large audience. We hope to learn important things about the speech patterns and ways of communicating, that are unique to this group of people by concentrating on these creative individuals.

The choice to examine such widely recognised female YouTubers' methods of communication was driven by their abilities to grab the interest and attention of a diverse spectrum of viewers. They were a perfect fit for our study because of their relatable content and significant influence on modern culture. We thought that by studying their communication habits in great detail, we may learn important things about how girls express themselves, engage with their audience, and contribute to the changing aspect of interaction.

Through an exploration of the varied material created by these female YouTubers, specifically their lifestyle vlogs and podcasts, our goal was to obtain a thorough grasp of the details and dynamics of female communication. Their willingness to engage with their audience, talk about relevant topics, and share personal stories gave us a special chance to examine the complexities on female communication.


# Methodology
For this study, We compiled a collection of YouTube videos that included talks and discourse around women and gender. The video selection process consisted of the following steps:
1. Keyword searches on YouTube for words like "women's issues," "gender equality," and "female empowerment."
2. Screening the search results to find relevant videos about female discourse, viewpoints, and experiences.
3. Using a video download tool, download the specified videos while maintaining the video, audio, and metadata components.
4. Transcribing video audio into text with automatic speech recognition software for additional analysis.




## Limitations and Assumptions
The following limitations and assumptions should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study:
The YouTube video dataset may not be completely representative of the larger female discourse because it is dependent on the content accessible on the site and the selection criteria utilised. As well as errors or biases during the process of the automatic voice recognition and sentiment analysis. Lastly, the scholars' viewpoints and theoretical frameworks impact the thematic analysis and interpretation of female discourse.

## Analysis
Basically, we have four types of annotations: fillers, tag questions, intensifiers and accent. Here are the definitions of these four types of annotations. 

**1) Fillers:**

Fillers play an important role in spoken language. A filler is any word or sound that interpolates (i.e., is inserted into) the main message of a speaker. Common fillers include “um”, “ah,” “like,” “so,” and “you know?” among others. Marked fillers will be defined as: 

```
Like: This is probably the most common filler word. It is often used to buy time while the speaker is thinking of what to say next.
Um: This is another very common filler word. It is often used to indicate hesitation or uncertainty.
Uh: This is a shorter version of "um" and is often used in the same way.
You know: This phrase is often used as a way to connect with the listener and make them feel like they are part of the conversation.
So: This word is often used to introduce a new thought or idea.
Well: This word is often used to indicate that the speaker is about to say something important.
I mean: This phrase is often used to clarify or rephrase what the speaker has just said.
And: This word is often used to connect two thoughts or ideas.
But: This word is often used to introduce a contrast or a different perspective.
Right: This word is often used to seek agreement from the listener.

Uh-huh: This sound is often used to indicate agreement or understanding.
Hmm: This sound is often used to indicate that the speaker is thinking.
Er: This sound is often used to indicate hesitation or uncertainty.

```

```
We use "{}" to mark fillers. For example, "{Well}, I guess we could go to the park, or we could stay home and watch a movie."
```

**2) Tag questions:**

A tag question is a construction in which an interrogative element is added to a declarative or an imperative clause. The resulting speech act comprises an assertion paired with a request for confirmation. For instance, the English tag question "You're John, aren't you?" consists of the declarative clause "You're John" and the interrogative tag "aren't you?".

```
We use "[]" to mark tag questions. For example, "You're coming with us, [aren't you]?"
"He won't be late, [will he]?"
"We had a great time, [didn't we]?"
```

**3) Intensifiers:**


Intensifiers are adverbs or adverbial phrases that strengthen the meaning of other expressions and show emphasis. Words that we commonly use as intensifiers include absolutely, completely, extremely, highly, rather, really, so, too, totally, utterly, very and at all:

he has a _**very**_ strict teacher.

Don’t work _**too**_ hard. Sometimes you’ll get more done by relaxing a bit.

I don’t think she understood the topic and her essay was _**rather**_ a mess.

She’s _**really**_ offended her sister.

At all is a _**very**_ common intensifier with negative expressions:

Are there no suitable DVDs _**at all**_?

I’m afraid I’m not _**at all**_ interested.

We also use on earth and _**ever**_ as intensifiers with wh-words:

_**What on earth**_ is he doing? (suggests disapproval)

Why did I _**ever**_ invite them to stay with us? (suggests that there were problems)

```
We use "<>" to mark intensifier. For example, "That movie was <incredibly> good."
"She’s <really> offended her sister."
"I am <really> tired after a long day at work."
```
**4) Accent:**
Basically, we distinguish British accent and American accent. We will mark the accent before speaker’s monologue.

&a = American (General) 
&b = British (BBC)

```
For example,
&a
"Good evening guys,..."

```

```

# Discussion
This section  will present will the key results that our study has found from the data.
Thematic analysis of video transcripts showed numerous key themes that characterise the female conversation contained in the data. An overarching theme was the emphasis on human experiences and the sharing of real, ordinary stories. Women frequently highlighted mental health, relationships, professional issues, and work-life balance, emphasising the breadth of their lived experiences.

## Findings
After analysing the data, we have found that the most likley type of annotaion to appear in female discourse in the context of vlogs and podcasts are the fillers and intensifiers. This commonality between the vlogs and podcasts  that we have collected showed that the mostly used filler word was "like" and as for intensifiers "really." From this result, although not conclusive, we can observe the linguistic features in female discourse during the context of vlogs and podcasts include a lot informal words.

The data we collected were both american female speakers and british female speakers, that were between the ages of early 20s to late 20s and from a caucasian middle class background. Due to time contraints, a more representative and diverse dataset of female speakers could not be collected. It is vital to realise the study's limitations, which were mostly based on a single platform (YouTube) and may not have captured the entire spectrum of female conversation across multiple digital channels. Furthermore, while the automated sentiment analysis used in this study provided useful insights, it may have inherent biases and ambiguities in the perception of emotional expressions.

Future study might broaden the data sources to cover a greater variety of digital platforms, formats, and geographic locations. A mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative studies may also result in a more complete knowledge of female discourse and its varied character. Collaboration with various groups and subject matter experts might improve the understanding and application of the findings.


## Conclusion
To conclude,this study provides important insights into the representation, topics, and rhetorical methods that distinguish female speech in YouTube vlogs and podcasts. The findings help to deepen our knowledge of how women use digital platforms to express their experiences, assert their agency, and impact public narratives about gender and intersectional concerns.
