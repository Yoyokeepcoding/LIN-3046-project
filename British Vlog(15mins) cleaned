people who don't like to over complicate me or who
don't want to think about what to make or how
many ingredients they need and the time and everything it's
super simple if I could do it you guys can
absolutely do it today we're making spicy creamy cajun chicken
pasta nice and easy it's going to take 20 minutes
I have the exact ingredients that I need let me
boil the pasta and get it started I haven't got
long before love Island begins so that's over there boiling
I'm gonna chop up the shallot as well as the
garlic I've actually never really used shallot before like I've
never like cooked with it so that should be interesting
so I'm going to chop that up foreign oh okay
the real test how is it it's a good okay
let me try this one always make some time for
some posture um this doesn't taste like I made it
which I like I don't know if anyone's like me
but if I eat my own food I just don't
have the appetite for my own food that's why I
even made my bowl small or smaller but it tastes
like someone else made it so I want to finish
it now because these are like different ingredients really tasty
anyway I'm gonna finish my meal thank you to hello
