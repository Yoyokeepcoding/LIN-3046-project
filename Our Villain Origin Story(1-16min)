like what's going on yeah we are drinking a matcha
of course and were wearing twin outfits were wearing sparkly
gold Bando tops and black jeans gold and pink pink
with gold specks we now live together in New York
City as of September 2023 mhm and it's been quite
a crazy journey and since moving here we have become
the beautiful twin sisters and how did that happen let
us explain our villain origin story the lore we're getting
deep into the lore this story actually begins in the
lovely neighborhood of Williamsburg Brooklyn where us two just
sisters at the time were just being Brooklyn baddies
and we're walking down a regular Street in Williamsburg
when all of a sudden a man there was a
man sitting on on the street for some reason the
street is like a little bit sketch and you know
what he says to us as we pass by beautiful
twin sisters and we're like but the thing is
no I think someone already before was like said
like we already got cat called on that street like
a second before yeah like a second before we're already
on high alert and then a man just regular man
sitting down just hits us with the beautiful twin sisters
and we're like we're like ain't no way he just
it was crazy but also we were like wow kind
of iconic that's iconic not only are we beautiful
women we're beautiful twin sisters so we have yeah
we have since just claimed that name it's who
we are our original government birthdays are actually two
years apart Amber is younger by two years do not
that's actually guys like you need to keep this on
the down low like I'm telling you guys because
we're besties but like literally do not spread this
because it's actually as misinformation it's misinformation fake news
propaganda propaganda um but so Amber is according to the
government years younger two years younger I am 2 years
older uh 23 years old no you're not my God
I'm going to literally okay I was 24 I'm so
sorry I literally keep forgetting that I got older but
and I'm 22 now I was born in 2001 Ash
was born in 1999 yeah but you didn't hear from
us you didn't hear from us because actually we are
jointly 23 with a joint birthday of October 14th
okay get the facts straight the only we twins that's
the full truth only truth don't get twisted we're
to beautiful twin sisters don't get it twisted oh also
for the people who are just don't get twisted that's
actually like kind of our like we always say like
we are the beautiful twin sisters don't get it
twisted that's actually such a funny phrase no wait merch
the merch is like don't get it twisted that's
so crazy yeah um but also for the audio listeners
I drew a little photo behind us that's says beautiful
twin sisters podcast and it's a little stick figure drawing
of the two of us MH in our current outfits
and it's awesome and so if you guys are
wondering how we know each other well we've known
each other since the our sisterly relationship womb yes
and we have grown up together always been besties
I feel like we're both really lucky that we've
always like liked each other each other and just like
been literally best friends like I feel like Amber's like
the one person where I can literally be like that's
my best friend yeah that's kind of crazy this is
getting emotional anyways I'm going to cry I'm going
to cry no but literally like people always DM
us and comment like oh I wish I had your guys'
sibling relationship like me and my siblings are not
that close I'm like damn I don't know how we
did it but our whole lives we've always been like
this intertwined didn't even have to try so I
am we are so blessed for that yeah we were
just lucky enough to get along well and I think
both of us like we don't really hold grudges
like I think we can get like as regular siblings
do like get annoyed at each other but the grudge
like goes away after like hours even so when Ashley
did a backflip onto Amber’s eye not like I'm ever
feeling like violent towards my siblings like except for
that one time when you uh beat me up literally
I was like 11 years old and you still bring
this up how I like it's because you did a
backflip on the trampoline into my eye like you
literally like your whole entire body like landed on
my eye and so I rightfully like ripped your
hair out yeah and my friend was over and watched


When Ashley did a backflip on to Amber’s eye
Not like I'm ever feeling like violent towards my siblings
Like except for that one time when you uh beat me up
Literally I was like 11 years old and you still bring this up
How I like it's because you did a backflip on the trampoline into my eye
Like you literally like your whole entire body Like landed 
on my eye and so I rightfully like ripped your hair out
Yeah and my friend was over and watched the whole thing
And then she had to go home that's so that was our one moment
Where we kind of tripped up yeah don't get it twisted
Also wait like are you even siblings if you don't do that
Yeah who hasn't done that there's nobl gotten mauled by their sibling
Yeah but really BTSP being mentioned in 2020 Quick I
want to show you because we are the beautiful twin sisters
And this is kind of a new thing since we've moved to New York City together
MH I wanted to show you I was looking at my own YouTube channel
The other night which is kind of embarrassing I don't know how I stumbled
Upon this clip but you have to watch this
This is from December 2020 are you ready for this
This you have no idea what's in here like you've never posted this online
This is on my YouTube channel oh okay yeah this is public okay
But watch we haven't seen this in like 3 years okay
Should I just copy Ash's hair completely I think you should just copy
My hair completely should and then we could be like can like make videos
And be like doing this with my twin then everyone be like wait are they twins
Might also cause Mass confusion but as fine
I that's what I love to do isn't that the point of being on social media
Is that not the point thanks for tuning in guys wa
Isn't that crazy it's like literally the seed had been planted
The prophecy has been fulfilled wow it's crazy
That video is from 2020 and I've like I don't like that video
I have not watched it since and I don't know why I clicked on it
The other day and skipped to the end specifically to watch that segment
I was like where did that come from the idea has always been in here
That man was a sign from the universe to bring the idea back into our head
That man on the street that uh cat called us so aggressively
He knew but it was God's plan God's plan actually
That was not a man that was God himself
No and we just had the nerve to walk by him and not even give him a second look
He literally the man that would guide the rest of our podcast career
Crazy that's insane but that's so funny cuz this is actually causing Mass confusion
If you like look at some of our Tik Tok comments
Where in videos where we're like haha we're twins
He like the top comments always like how did I not know they were twins
I never realized you're Twins and every 's like yeah they're they've been twins
So it's literally terrible cuz it's like if you guys are in on it
Then like you also like help gasl people yeah
But it's okay if you are a viewer a listener of the beautiful twin sisters podcast
You have to troll on our behalf you have to gas light the public
Respond to every comment being like yeah they've been twins
Where have you been they've been saying this your civic duty mhm
So as part of our little Community we have here exactly
Also just to get to know better since this is episode one We're our individual lore

Going to give you guys a little spiel about ourselves 
individually so you know the host Ashley would you like to begin
Of course, well first off I would like to say thank you so much for watching the podcast
I think a lot of you guys that are coming here especially for the first episode
already know us from YouTube that is our true passions in life our main platforms 
um and it's where I think most of you guys would know us from so I
have been doing YouTube since 2018 um along with my beautiful sister right
here and so in the beginning Amber would always sometimes
be behind the camera and then she'll be behind the camera for extra Dynamic 
and then sometimes she'd be in front of the camera for extra Dynamic I've had a podcast in the past
in like 2020 2021 and you guys have been begging for it to come back and so now it's coming
back bigger and better than ever in a new form in a new form yeah 
I think it'll be more sustainable got co-host this time 
got co-host so I won't be like talking into the void um 
but that's just like kind of my little background SP anyways where I 
was born I was born in lovely Upstate New York that is where I was born and 
raised that is also where I went to college so I have literally lived in New York my
entire life even right now the apartment that we're sitting 
in this beautiful couch that I'm sitting on is in New York
City never thought I would live in New York City 
though cuz really was racist Suburban girly and if you're wondering a
little bit about our background both Amber and I are half Korean 
our mom is Korean she's from Seoul and she moved to the United States when she 
was 12 and then our dad yeah 12 or 13 I'm pretty sure it's 12 though sry mom mom always
get so much cuz I literally mess it up every time and I always get it
right and you always get it wrong but now I don't remember which number is right anyways
I'm pretty positive 12 sorry Mom and then our dad is just white so that's the
tea he's like British Scottish German German French European mix family came
over in like pilgrim times like American through and through yeah so that's our
dad's side and now we're here on the planet it's crazy um and then for my
little introduction my name is Amber if you forgot I am 22 okay which is 
also fake news but um I went to so we both grew up in Upstate New York together 
and where Ashley has always been in New York I moved to Southern California for college 
where I went to Chapman University and I studied film and television I was a television
writing and production major so I was all about that camera uh doing short
films for my homework assignments but now I am not pursuing any of that because honestly I did it's kind of just
too weird of a thing for me I don't know doing film and TV is kind of just like
crazy Vibe was not super into it and so now I'm full-time podcasting I'm just
kidding I'm just kidding I'm just kidding but actually so after college um
I moved to New York City to live with Ashley in this apartment it's been my plan
since like senior year of college was kind of when I realized I didn't want to do the
Classic route where you move to LA and work in there I wanted to actually live in like a walkable City
and be with my sister and be close to my family so it was definitely to move yeah and both of us do YouTube Amber has a
very successful YouTube channel so it's kind of like you 
kind of realized you already had like one foot in the door
with YouTube you already had built up your platform to like
an extent where you could be full-time with it and so
you decided hey rather than start at Square zero unpaid 
internship in the film in Los Angeles yeah you would just
try out YouTube give it a try why not you're young what better time than now
to live in New York City yeah and I'm loving it I love just
uh making a little videos talking to you guys is so much
fun literally like I don't know cuz doing film school was fun but the
like energy there is so Cutthroat for no reason I'm like this is 
literally like could be the most fun job in the world

if y'all just chilled out but I it was not like that so I was 
like I don't really feel like it anyway so that is
basically our backgrounds yeah is us we also have a younger brother
named Andrew who's still in college he's in Southern California at 
Chapman the same school I went to so that is why he is not here
with us yes and he's studying business like me which I realized I forgot to fully say like where I went to college
but I actually had kind of a really not like effed up College like EXP not the
The Experience wasn't effed up but I went to like many different colleges 
just because of interesting things and covid and what not so basically when 
I first went to college I went to George Washington University which is in
Washington DC I went there for one semester and it was a nice college but 
being a Suburban girly going to a city even I know that DC is like not nearly 
as like bustling as New York City but for me at the time it was too much I was
also 17 when I went to college I was a little baby I was really like not 
that independent dependent like I feel like when I moved to college I 
remember like getting lunch by myself on like orientation day and being 
like this is like my first time getting lunch by 
myself ever in my whole life like isn't that crazy so I was just like not prepared to go to college in like any
regard and then I was like suddenly there in a different state like all by myself it was interesting I didn't
really love it there I think mostly because my dorm was on this weird other
dorm called Mount Vernon which was like so far away from the main campus and it
just kind of like made my college experience weird cuz like I would have 
to go down to the main campus and sometimes it would like take an hour or
like two hours with traffic literally so it was just super isolating it was a
little more isolating and I also didn't put myself out there to make friends
when I first went to college just cuz I had like literally no idea what I 
was doing I was on the cheerleading team though and that was fun however the
coach was a little bit crazy and would insinuate drama within all of the 
cheerleaders for no goddamn reason and so that also made me feel weird and 
then I was like m um I actually really had a vision that I wanted to transfer back
home to an apartment in our home state but I decided that I wanted to transfer back home 
I literally I remember being in DC at my desk and being like I 
really want to start YouTube but I know I want to start it with my siblings I need to
transfer back home and I remember talking to one of my good friends at the time about it 
and then she was like I think your siblings are fine like I think you 
you'll be fine in DC for like another semester and also that was really nice of her and she was like one
of my only good friends her name is SEMA at the time like in DC and she definitely was right cuz I was like
getting nervous that you and Andrew like couldn't fend for yourselves which is like so
dumb even though you totally could but I was like I just want to go
back home with my siblings and like you guys are my best friends so I think I 
just missed you guys as my friends mostly um and she was like girlfriend
you're fine and I was like I'm going to transfer and so I transferred um and then 
I transferred to RPI which is in Upstate New York it was close enough that 
I could commute like from home and then to school and there I was I think I
actually entered in as a Psychology major but I was always like either like biology or psych like between the two
cuz I wanted to be preed and with Premed you can kind of do any major really as
long as you hit those prequisites that you need to be a Premed student like you could be a Psychology major as long as
you take all the bio bio physics chem all of those do you know what I mean
maybe you don't know what I mean anyways that is what I did for pretty 
much my first three years of College was be a
stem major because I thought I was going to be a doctor at the same time as I was kind of doing that I also started
YouTube side by side and we'll probably have a full podcast about like my specific YouTube journey and college
Journey so I don't want to get like too into it right now but I did that kind of side by side
until I got to the point where I realized hey actually I can do
YouTube full-time so I am not going to take Oro yeah during my last year of
college because I don't need to and I'll graduate with a business degree and 
I ended up somehow managing to graduate with a business degreeSure! Here's the reformatted text with 10 words per line:
