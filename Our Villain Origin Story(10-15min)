that one time when you {uh} beat me up literally
I was {like} 11 years old and you still bring
this up how I like it's because you did a
backflip on the trampoline into my eye {like} you
literally like your whole entire body {like} landed on
my eye and so I rightfully like ripped your
hair out {yeah} and my friend was over and watched
When Ashley did a backflip on to Amberâ€™s eye
Not like I'm ever feeling {like} violent towards my siblings
{Like} except for that one time when you {uh} beat me up
Literally I was {like} 11 years old and you still bring this up
How I like it's because you did a backflip on the trampoline into my eye
{like} you literally {like} your whole entire body {like} landed 
on my eye and so I rightfully {like} ripped your hair out
{yeah} and my friend was over and watched the whole thing
And then she had to go home that's so that was our one moment
where we kind of tripped up {yeah} don't get it twisted
also wait {like} are you even siblings if you don't do that
{yeah} who hasn't done that there's nobl gotten mauled by their sibling
{yeah} but <really> BTSP being mentioned in 2020 quick I
want to show you because we are the beautiful twin sisters
and this is kind of a new thing since we've moved to New York City together
I wanted to show you I was looking at my own YouTube channel
The other night which is kind of embarrassing I don't know how I stumbled
upon this clip but you have to watch this
this is from December 2020 are you ready for this
this you have no idea what's in here {like} you've never posted this online
This is on my YouTube channel oh okay {yeah} this is public okay
But watch we haven't seen this in {like} 3 years okay
should I just copy Ash's hair completely I think you should just copy
my hair completely should and then we could be {like} can {like} make videos
And be like doing this with my twin then everyone be {like} wait are they twins
might also cause mass confusion but as fine
I that's what I love to do isn't that the point of being on social media
is that not the point thanks for tuning in guys wa
isn't that crazy it's {like} literally the seed had been planted
the prophecy has been fulfilled wow it's crazy
that video is from 2020 and I've like I don't like that video
I have not watched it since and I don't know why I clicked on it
The other day and skipped to the end specifically to watch that segment
I was {like} where did that come from the idea has always been in here
That man was a sign from the universe to bring the idea back into our head
That man on the street that uh cat called us so aggressively
He knew but it was God's plan God's plan actually
That was not a man that was God himself
No and we just had the nerve to walk by him and not even give him a second look
He literally the man that would guide the rest of our podcast career
Crazy that's insane but that's so funny cuz this is actually causing mass confusion
If you like look at some of our Tik Tok comments
Where in videos where we're {like} haha we're twins
He {like} the top comments always {like} how did I not know they were twins
I never realized you're Twins and every 's like {yeah} they're they've been twins
So it's literally terrible cuz it's {like} if you guys are in on it
Then like you also like help gas light  people {yeah}
But it's okay if you are a viewer a listener of the beautiful twin sisters podcast
You have to troll on our behalf you have to gas light the public
Respond to every comment being like yeah they've been twins
Where have you been they've been saying this your civic duty mhm
So as part of our little Community we have here exactly
Also just to get to know better since this is episode one We're our individual lore
