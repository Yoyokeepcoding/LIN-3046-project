Going to give you guys a little spiel about ourselves 
individually so you know the host Ashley would you like to begin
Of course, well first off I would like to say thank you so much for watching the podcast
I think a lot of you guys that are coming here especially for the first episode
already know us from YouTube that is our true passions in life our main platforms 
{um} and it's where I think most of you guys would know us from so I
have been doing YouTube since 2018 {um} along with my beautiful sister right
here and so in the beginning Amber would always sometimes
be behind the camera and then she'll be behind the camera for extra Dynamic 
and then sometimes she'd be in front of the camera 
for extra Dynamic I've had a podcast in the past
in like 2020 2021 and you guys have been begging
for it to come back and so now it's coming
back bigger and better than ever in a new form 
in a new form {yeah} I think it'll be more 
sustainable got co-host this time got co-host so I won't
be like talking into the void {um} but that's 
just like kind of my little background SP anyways where I 
was born I was born in lovely Upstate New York that is where I was born and 
raised that is also where I went to college so I have literally lived in New York my
entire life even right now the apartment that we're sitting 
in this beautiful couch that I'm sitting on is in New York
City never thought I would live in New York City 
though cuz really was racist Suburban girly and if you're wondering a
little bit about our background both Amber and I are half Korean 
our mom is Korean she's from Seoul and she moved to the United States when she 
was 12 and then our dad {yeah} 12 or 13 I'm pretty sure it's 12 though 
sry mom mom always get so much cuz I literally
mess it up every time and I always get it right and 
you always get it wrong but now I don't remember which number is right anyways
I'm pretty positive 12 sorry Mom and then our dad is just white so that's the
tea he's like british scottish german french european mix family came
over in {like} pilgrim times {like} American through and through 
{yeah so} that's our dad's side and now we're here on 
the planet it's crazy um and then for my little introduction
my name is Amber if you forgot I am 22 okay which is 
also fake news but um I went to so we both grew up in 
Upstate New York together and where Ashley has always 
been in New York I moved to Southern California for college 
where I went to Chapman university and I studied film and 
television I was a television writing and production major so 
I was all about that camera {uh} doing short films
for my homework assignments but now I am not pursuing 
any of that because honestly I did it's kind of just
too weird of a thing for me I don't know doing film 
and TV is kind of just {like} crazy Vibe was not
super into it and so now I'm full-time podcasting I'm just
kidding but actually so after college {um} I moved to 
New York City to live with Ashley in this apartment 
it's been since {like} senior year of college was 
kind of when I realized I didn't want to do the
classic route where you move to LA and work 
in there I wanted to actually live in like a walkable City
and be with my sister and be close to my family so it was
definitely to move {yeah} and both of us do YouTube Amber has a
very successful YouTube channel so it's kind of {like} you 
kind of realized you already had like one foot in the door
with YouTube you already had built up your platform to {like}
an extent where you could be full-time with it and so
you decided hey rather than start at Square zero unpaid 
internship in the film in Los Angeles {yeah} you would just
try out YouTube give it a try why not you're young what better time than now
to live in New York City yeah and I'm loving it I love just
uh making a little videos talking to you guys is so much
fun literally like I don't know cuz doing film school was fun but the
like energy there is so cutthroat for no reason I'm like this is 
literally like could be the most fun job in the world
