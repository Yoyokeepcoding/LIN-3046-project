if y'all just chilled out but I it was not
like that so I was {like} I don't really feel {like} 
it anyway so that is basically our backgrounds 
{yeah} is us we also have a younger brother named 
andrew who's still in college he's in Southern California at 
Chapman the same school I went to so that is 
why he is not here with us yes and 
he's studying business like me which I realized I forgot 
to fully say {like} where I went to college but
I actually had kind of a <really> not {like} effed up
college {like} experience not the the Experience wasn't
effed up but I went to like many different colleges 
just because of interesting things and covid and what not 
so basically when I first went to college 
I went to George Washington University which is in
Washington DC I went there for one semester and it was
a nice college but being a Suburban girly going to a city
even I know that DC is {like} not nearly as {like}
bustling as New York City but for me at the time it was too much I was
also 17 when I went to college I was a little baby I was 
<really> {like} not that independent dependent {like} I feel {like}
when I moved to college I remember {like} getting lunch
by myself on {like} orientation day and being {like} 
this is {like} my first time getting lunch by myself
ever in my whole life {like} isn't that crazy so I was 
just {like} not prepared to go to college in {like} any
regard and then I was {like} suddenly there in a different
state {like} all by myself it was interesting I didn't
really love it there I think mostly because my dorm 
was on this weird other dorm called Mount Vernon 
which was {like} so far away from the main campus and it
just kind of like made my college experience weird cuz
{like} I would have to go down to the main campus
and sometimes it would like take an hour or
{like} two hours with traffic literally so it 
was just super isolating it was a little more isolating 
and I also didn't put myself out there to make friends
when I first went to college just cuz I had {like} literally no idea what 
I was doing I was on the cheerleading team though 
and that was fun however the coach was a little bit crazy
and would insinuate drama within all of the cheerleaders for no goddamn 
reason and so that also made me feel weird and then I was 
{like um} I actually really had a vision that I wanted to transfer back
home to an apartment in our home state but I decided 
that I wanted to transfer back home I literally I remember being
in DC at my desk and being like I <really> want to start 
YouTube but I know I want to start it with my siblings I need to
transfer back home and I remember talking to one of 
my good friends at the time about it and then 
she was {like} I think your siblings are fine like 
I think you you'll be fine in DC
