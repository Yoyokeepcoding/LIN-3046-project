LIN3046 Group Report: Female Discourse Research
===========================

# Introduction

## Descriptive Data

    Basic idea of our data.

## Research Question(s) or problem addressed

According to Lakoff (1975), there are nine women’s language features: lexical hedges or fillers, tag question, empty adjectives, precise color terms, intensifiers, hypercorrect grammar, superpolite forms, avoidance of strong swear words, and emphatic stress, which attract widely attention of linguistic and gender scholars. 
Focusing on the three features "fillers", "tag questions" and "intensifiers", the aim of this project is to investigate and analyze the discourse features exhibited in the speech of women, with a particular focus on Emma Chamberlain's speaking style on YouTube. By examining her communication patterns and linguistic choices, we seek to gain insights into the unique characteristics and dynamics of female discourse.

  ### a.Description of the scope and the rationale of the project
  
  The scope of this project extends beyond the individual analysis of Emma Chamberlain's speech. She serves as a representative example, allowing us to explore and understand broader patterns and tendencies in women's speech features. By studying her speaking style, we aim to identify and analyze the linguistic elements, intonation patterns, vocabulary choices, conversational strategies, and other discourse features that contribute to the formation of a distinct female communication style.

  Our rationale for selecting Emma Chamberlain as a subject of study stems from her prominent presence on YouTube and her influence as a content creator. Through her videos, she engages with a wide audience and exhibits a unique way of expressing herself. By delving into her speech patterns and examining the underlying factors that contribute to her communication style, we can shed light on the larger discourse practices and language patterns employed by women in various contexts.
  
  ### b.Potential use cases and future development
  
  Understanding female discourse features has implications across various domains, including linguistics, gender studies, media analysis, and communication research. By uncovering the distinctive linguistic markers and discourse strategies employed by women like Emma Chamberlain, we can gain insights into the dynamics of gendered communication and contribute to the development of more inclusive and equitable linguistic practices.

This research has the potential to inform communication training programs, public speaking courses, and media production practices, enabling individuals and organizations to better understand and utilize effective communication strategies while respecting diverse discourse styles. Furthermore, the findings from this project can serve as a foundation for future research on female discourse features, providing a basis for comparative studies and expanding our understanding of gendered communication dynamics.

### c.Relevant licensing issues and ethical concerns

  Throughout this project, we are committed to upholding ethical standards and ensuring compliance with relevant licensing requirements. Any data collected or analyzed from Emma Chamberlain's YouTube videos will be done so within the boundaries of fair use and the platform's terms of service. We respect the privacy and intellectual property rights of content creators and will handle the data collected with utmost care and confidentiality. Furthermore, any insights or findings resulting from this research will be presented in an ethical manner, with proper acknowledgement and citation of the sources.

# Dataset

Here should describe our basic idea of dataset. Introduce this part will contain those items:
a. Transcription(Audio only) b. Segmentation c. Metadata d. Annotation

## Transcription

Here should be put our original transcrption (complete text or just an excerpt as an example???) 

## Segmentation

I’m not sure what this part actually contain?? Talk about how we cut the original transcript??

## Metadata

Metadata is 'data about data', which means a structured data excerpted from the information resource and be used to describe its characteristics and content. It is used to organize, describe, retrieve, preserve and manage information and knowledge resources.

Therefore, what is the metadata for our collected data? --->
? The general information about the youtuber we colleted ?? which type of youtuber? her video style/ vibe (may influence the discourse feature)? 


# Methodology

General idea of methodology introduction: AI tools/ python/ manual work....

## Collection

```
Here introduce our collection approaches: use Browser plugin to acquire direct transcript from YouTube.
Data collection process is needed to introduce

```

## Cleaning

```
Here introduce our cleaning approaches: Chatgpt --> python + manual work

```

## Analysis

```
Here introduce the annotation of data. How many annotation we have? Why chose this symbol? How we annotate the data? Criterion of judgement?

```

## Meaning of the columns in textual data

```
We need to set a excel table for further analyze the data. Therefore, the columns meaning is needed to explain.
