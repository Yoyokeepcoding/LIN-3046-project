# Dataset

Here should describe our basic idea of dataset. Introduce this part will contain those items:
a. Transcription(Audio only) b. Segmentation c. Metadata d. Annotation

## Transcription

Here should be put our original transcrption (complete text or just an excerpt as an example???) 

## Segmentation

Iâ€™m not sure what this part actually contain?? Talk about how we cut the original transcript??

## Metadata

Metadata is 'data about data', which means a structured data excerpted from the information resource and be used to describe its characteristics and content. It is used to organize, describe, retrieve, preserve and manage information and knowledge resources.

Therefore, what is the metadata for our collected data? --->
? The general information about the youtuber we colleted ?? which type of youtuber? her video style/ vibe (may influence the discourse feature)? 


# Methodology

General idea of methodology introduction: AI tools/ python/ manual work....

## Collection

```
Here introduce our collection approaches: use Browser plugin to acquire direct transcript from YouTube.
Data collection process is needed to introduce

```

## Cleaning

```
Here introduce our cleaning approaches: Chatgpt --> python + manual work

```

## Analysis

```
Here introduce the annotation of data. How many annotation we have? Why chose this symbol? How we annotate the data? Criterion of judgement?

```

## Meaning of the columns in textual data

```
We need to set a excel table for further analyze the data. Therefore, the columns meaning is needed to explain.
