   a lot of people think of California and they think
   of san francisco Los Angeles the big city they think
   of Malibu they think of the mountains they think of
   these romantic things {but} a lot of california is not
   that a lot of California is <very> simple and normal
   the town that I grew up in is <so> boring
   it feels deserted feels like a ghost town and its
   always sort of {felt like} a ghost town {but} it
   feels <even more> like a ghost town now because it
   {just} feels like things are shutting down left and right
   every time I come back to visit another establishment has
   shut down a good example of that would be my
   elementary School my elementary School shut down its all boarded
   up it looks <exactly> the same as when I was
   there like I remember we did this art activity as
   a school one year a bunch of kids painted these
   tiles myself included {and} they put them up in the
   hallway {and} theyre still there {and} mine is still there
   I <really> dont want them to fully tear down the
   school {but} {also like} who cares build a shopping mall
   fuck it build another shopping mall fuck it I used
   to walk to school almost every morning with my dad
   and we would gossip {to be honest} on the way
   to school we would gossip I hate to admit it
   {but} I am born and bred to gossip like Ive
   been gossiping since I could talk my dad and I
   would be walking to school {and} Id be like this
   person {just} started dating this person {and} theyve been holding
   hands in the hallway {and} its so cringe ew its
   so cringe or Id be like you know that girl
   yesterday she went into my desk during recess {and} she
   stole my stickers stickers were a big deal in elementary
   school everybody collected stickers {and} {it was like} a form
   of currency {like} we would like trade stickers we would
   also trade rocks and we would also trade erasers so
   now Im realizing I was born and bred for gossiping
   and for drug dealing its in me actually no sorry
   not drug deal ing lets say entrepreneur R preneurship actually
   but it did have a drug dealing Vibe it was
   all sort of under the table cuz I dont think
   we were allowed to sell things or trade things at
   school I I dont think that was allowed {so} it
   all <very> hush hush el crystal had <terrible> school lunch
   {but} then again like when is school lunch ever delicious
   almost <never> {but} there was one school lunch option that
   was unbelievable {and} it was called galaxy pizza they were
   these prepackaged circular pizzas {and} the pizza sauce was spicy
   the lunch lady would always cook them a little bit
   too long so they were crispy {and} the cheese was
   burn oh my God I would fucking do anything to
   eat another galaxy pizza oh my god they were <so>
   good and whenever they had galaxy pizza at school I
   would tell my parents no need to pack a lunch
   I need 50 cents or 75 cents or however much
   it was cuz Im getting that pizza {yeah} Im getting
   that pizza {and} theyd serve it with a little carton
   of milk {and} I would drink the milk {and} I
   would hate it I didnt really like milk {but} I
   would drink it anyway pizza in milk for lunch {like}
   that is just <so> bad that is <so> bad <too
   much> dairy <too much> dairy I was <definitely> an anxious
   kid I remember going into the bathroom in moments of
   anxiety although I didnt know it was anxiety {yet} I
   {just} felt scared and I didnt know why but I
   remember in moments of anxiety I would go into the
   bathroom {and} I would suck my thumb because that was
   something that I did until I was {like} 12 years
   old I sucked my thumb Id go into the bathroom
   in the middle of the school day and have a
   thumb break I {just} take a little thumb break what
   listen Id head into the stall sit down on the
   seat close my eyes put the thumb in the mouth
   suck on it for a little bit open my eyes
   remove the thumb get back to it didnt harm anyone
   actually it did harm me long term because sucking my
   thumb destroyed my teeth and gave me a <really> bad
   overbite {and} I also think it gave me some jaw
   issues which then I had to correct with braces years
   later and wow I had a terrible orthodontic experience is
   that the right word I had a terrible experience with
