&a
braces I had braces for <so> long {and} I had
the <most> inconvenient appliances I had neck gear I had
<all> these weird wires {and} bands {and} stuff in my
mouth <all> the time it was terrible {um} <all> because
I sucked my thumb <so> warning {but} also no regrets
because I would have been a nervous wreck if I
did not suck my thumb as a kid {and} now
I have an oral fixation as an adult {and} {yeah}
it's not good I fell in love love it l
Crystal too {yeah} I did you'd think oh Emma you
were a kid you know you haven't <even> hit puberty
yet what do you mean you fell in love oh
no I did I did there was this one boy
oh I was obsessed I was <really> boy crazy {like}
a stalker not actually relax {but} I was <definitely> obsessed
this boy consumed me I wonder what he's doing now
I tried to find him on Instagram {and} I couldn't
I don't even think he has an Instagram oh what
I would do to find him on Instagram nope can't
find him we never dated {or} anything {but} he did
kiss my hand once that felt really good I I
never found out if he liked me back I don't
think he did {but} that's okay I at least got
the kiss on the hand no if he kissed me
on the hand he had to have liked me back
right today {actually} I was at my local Trader Joe's
{and} I saw a kid that was in my elementary
school class {and} I didn't recognize him {but} he came
up to me and he {was like} is your name
Emma chamber because I think we were in the same
Elementary School class {and} I {was like} that's fucking me
dude that's me what's going on every town has their
Main Street you know the street where <all> the restaurants
are the street where <all> the businesses are like it's
where <all> the business is right my hometown has that
{but} let me tell you nobody's making a special trip
to my hometown to visit this street there's not a
lot going on okay it's <very> <very> sleepy Lo locals
hit that street to hang out {just} because it's close
by you know not because it's a Vibe it's not
a Vibe it's not but that's actually what I think
is charming about it I <especially> spent a lot of
time on the street when I was under the age
of 10 because it was <all> I knew I will
say though there are a lot of hidden gems on
this street one of my favorites would have to be
my dad {and} I's go-to Market we would walk to
this Market <all> the time my dad would get the
groceries that he needed and you want to know what
I was doing I was looking into the pastry case
this Market had an iconic pastry case there were <so>
many <so> many good looking pastries in there <specifically> I
used to get churros a lot from there {but} there
was this other pastry that was in the pastry case
that I never tried because I was always allowed to
get one pastry and I always wanted the churro like
that was my priority this other pastry was enticing to
me but not as enticing to me {so} I would
always choose the churro instead even though I <really> did
want to try this other one {and} I've always wanted
to try it it's fucking amazing it is dry it
is {but} it is good I love it also on
this street there was my swimming class when I was
a kid my parents were like in this life if
you don't know how to swim you're fucking screwed you're
screwed and {so} they put me into swimming school for
a while it was it was great {you know} I
I think I <even> enjoyed it {but} then one day
we were playing this little game where we had to
swim to the bottom of the pool grab a little
toy from the bottom of the pool {and} then bring
it back up seems pretty easy I I think I
do have a little competitive streak in me okay yeah
I do not all the time I wouldn't consider myself
to be a competitive person {but} I have a competitive
streak in me it comes out sometimes times I was
feeling particularly competitive at swimming school one day {and} I
wanted to win this game {so} I swam to the
bottom of the pool to grab the little toy {and}
the toy kept slipping out of my hands kept slipping
out of my hands could not pick it up {but}
I was in a competitive frame of mind {so} I
was like fucking no I'm picking this thing up I
lost track of time and I was down there for
<too> long {and} I start running out of breath {and}
I kind of gasp for air a little bit {and}
I start sort of getting water in my mouth {and}
it freaks me the fucking out I have a vivid
memory of being at the bottom of the pool {and}
looking up {and} the surface {just} looking <so> far away
{and} I was like oh my God I'm going to
drown I am going to die {so} I started swimming
back up without the toy I didn't have the toy
in my hand {and} the pool {was like} 6 ft
deep {and} I was a kid okay I {was like}
four or 5 years old I swim to the top
{and} I'm gasping for air {and} I just start balling
my eyes out I get out of the pool I
don't tell the teacher fucking I go into the little
room that <all> the parents would hang out in I
find my mom {and} I say I'm <never> going back
there I'm done I'm done with
