you guys can absolutely do it today we're making spicy
creamy cajun chicken pasta nice and easy it's going to
take 20 minutes I have the exact ingredients that I
need let me boil the pasta and get it started
I haven't got long before love Island begins so that's
over there boiling I'm gonna chop up the shallot as
well as the garlic I've actually never really used shallot
before like I've never like cooked with it so that
should be interesting so I'm going to chop that up
foreign oh okay the real test how is it it's
a good okay let me try this one always make
some time for some posture um this doesn't taste like
I made it which I like I don't know if
anyone's like me but if I eat my own food
I just don't have the appetite for my own food
that's why I even made my bowl small or smaller
but it tastes like someone else made it so I
want to finish it now because these are like different
ingredients really tasty anyway I'm gonna finish my meal thank
you to hello fresh for sponsoring this video I will

because yeah as you guys can see I've got my
hair done I did boho braids by um zuri hair
studios she's amazing we've got like human hairs I could
actually curl these pieces if I wanted to and then
this is expression I always get questions on like what
colors she used because I go to her often she
kind of just knows what colors work for my hair
she knows better than I do she usually like legit
customizes it to me so she gets I think quite
a lot of hair she didn't get started from Brenda's
puts it together brushes it out and then we've got
magic I absolutely love this this is like the first
type of braids I can actually just put in a
hairband and up my hair and it's super light not
putting on my edges um my forehead is just out
to the world but when is it not um and
yeah and then I got my lashes done by Trish's
lash bar I said I wanted like a bit hybrid
a bit of a mix kind of wanted to look
like ship lashes and she did that and I love
that she's like the only person I really really trusts
my lashes I think I'm back and I think it
goes with the hair like boho you know I feel
like I'm in my Zoe Kravitz era of this look
absolutely love it and this hairstyle apparently should last me
a while people always say that this gets really matted
but I'm good because it's human hair I'm really good
if it's not expression or anything down here so I
just put water wet it and then I'm at the
door but yeah um what else I'm going to do

I was a bit like uh but then now that
I'm listening to it more and then I was I
can't I was really upset when I first heard it
and now I was talking about she loves it and
I was sad I'm the beginning no it took me
a minute from the beginning I'm gonna play that I
was thinking wrong in my ass walking your ears off
thinking this has been recording and it has not been
recorded thank you because I will literally be talking talking
yeah and yeah it's because of the red light and
then the red light wasn't on it's so really nice
wow oh guys we are on our way we are
ready um we are stuck in traffic very embarrassing oh
my God it's everywhere what the hell this is because
of this whole dramatic she's like I scored a ride
it's just so dramatic because it does not take me
this long to get to all these red lights has
traffic I'm gonna go yeah but you think we're going
to your sides if english haven't enough we're 30 minutes
away for no reason yeah it really should be fast
anyway what should we do guys what game should I
play okay you can't really play music I mean I
could but I just now get copyrighted yeah they're gone
for my neck yeah even things that are like anyways
what you like random songs that I shouldn't be that
should be royalty free that aren't like yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah they're fun yeah they'll find a sample
and then yep majority of my videos have been copyrighted
that's why you guys can't download my vlogs if you
can't download my book logs that just means really you've
got another vlogs if they're copyrighted it's not yeah because
it's copyrighted yeah you can't download it which is really
annoying because it will say for a while oh it's
checks have gone through that's the thing and then a
week later no it's really annoying so I try not
to have any music I think I should just avoid
it but I love having music you know it's just
the Vibes people get to understand the vibes my taste
for the holiest I do on spotify is so old
I really need to update my music right I literally
listen to the same five songs yeah same beyonce albums
came out every time a new album comes out I'll
just play the entire thing entire thing on tithing until
I get bored of it yep yeah then I'm stuck
every time I listen to beyonce I like it more
and more yeah well I liked from the beginning yeah
he likes from the beginning but me I was just
a bit like a little bit of queer music for
the girls in the game it is for the girls
and the girls it really is it really is so
quiet I just love calvin harris but my thing is
like where in England is he from I feel like
he left the UK and then never came back oh
I was gonna say no but I was like who
is this man yeah no money you know I've been
looking at it the videos of Fifth Harmony because obviously
I think it's like 10 years and like they were
so out of sync last time Nah if you guys
much have got seen on twitter the videos on fifth
harmony they're just so cute I need to watch I
think they're on twitter maybe on twitter I couldn't give
in to the brand I wouldn't I couldn't get it
I couldn't but the brand that was together it just
didn't really mix it wasn't like a little mix I
can blend into little mix I can get into flow
I can get into these girl bands yes fifth harmony
