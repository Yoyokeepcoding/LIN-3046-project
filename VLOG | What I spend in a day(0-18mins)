to the post office then my nails then my smear
test and then my laser we are a busy today
busy okay oh it's a little chilly today it's a
little chilly I'm gonna really try and see if I
can actually um figure out how to work my suction
um mount for the camera ah okay let me try
and wipe this damn thing because I really want to
be vlogging for you guys but it's like I don't
know how this I don't know how this thing works
it's been pissing me off and and like I think
my windshield is quite low so I can't even really
now you're good it's gonna have to find a way
I didn't spend my money on this oh okay um
how does this work somebody help me I Dismount camera
suction thing I've given up on it completely so yeah
anyway I'm making my way to the post office you're
selling my wardrobe I should still have things um on
the website I'll link it down below hello I'm good
thank you how are you just this package please I
really want to record just like this no I need
to figure out a way to make my camera work
this this suction I've got the box here and it
doesn't give me the instructions it has to be like
a sticky part but nothing is coming off whatever anyway
let me go get my nails done I'm gonna go
for black and I'm probably gonna get black again because
I am absolutely obsessed oh people have manners should I
go for something different with my nails I feel like
I should just get the same thing I don't know
guys it's so weird to actually vlogging behind the wall
what the hell oh me that's used to Vlog it
in an Uber we love growth [Music] hello guys so
I'm back my nails I got black again shock but
honestly I tried to get a different color um I've
only got three minutes left to film how much content
have I got on this memory card you know what
I'm just gonna go home anyway because yeah like I
was saying anyway my I tried to get like a
really gorgeous dark khaki color what is he doing anyway
um I tried to get a dark khaki color they
didn't have it available which was really annoying so then
I what did I do yeah and I'm just getting
black so my nails an infill and of color gel
color cost 30 pounds it's actually quite steep for an
info you know for an infill when I think about
it anyway and then I went to this really really
cute um italian cafe and just got a slice um
pizza slice as well as an ice chai latte this
was six pounds in total hmm Lord have mercy but
anyway I'm gonna go home I need to actually there's
parking I actually paid for two hours and I've got
an hour left so I'm gonna quickly run and get
um my dry cleaning I forgot to bring it with
me very annoying but I'm gonna go there get it
come back drop my things and then go for my
smear test it's at 2 30 so yeah let me
head off so guys managed to go home finish my
pizza slice come back because I still had my parking
that I paid for what a good value for two
of well I'm already a good bag I was able
to kill two birds of one stone went to my
dry cleaning it was an appointment I just walked in
um I got my tailoring everything it's gonna cost upwards
of 88 pounds because I have some honey for trousers
do you guys remember this outfit I completely it was
many at its fault but whatever it was like literally
a year ago I ripped them and it pulled them
and he I don't know why I was still on
them so he pulled them and it ripped completely so
um I asked them to do it up and that's
going to be expensive because it's like hand stitching it's
really really careful really really good material so it's gonna
take a while and then I got like my Balenciaga
jeans needed to be taken in and some trousers I
got from Asos need to be taken in I'll see
if I can include it into this video but I
tried to film it at the dryer cleaners I've got
the worst angle ever oh I was meant to go
home and clear out my storage let me see if
I can do that now but anyway I'm gonna go
to my smear appointment because I'm on time I've really
got a lot done today I'm so so happy um
but yeah let me try to clear some storage and
then make my way to the appointment [Music] I accidentally
went through well I didn't I think I'm going oh
is my son coming but yeah so charge that to
the game charge that um [Music] why is it not
moving we need lip balm as well hey oh yeah

okay obviously like um you're really meant to get it
two no six months before you turn 25 yes six
months before honestly I've been delaying I've been delaying I've
been delaying it been delaying it pressure it was uncomfortable
it was definitely uncomfortable but it wasn't like painful for
me anyways um yeah it was it was quick and
it was quick it was I was literally in and
out like 20 minutes um now I'm off to my
laser appointment I just get my knee from my knee
downwards I get a full Hollywood and underarms as well
so um yeah I'm gonna also try to see if
I can get a lip balm anywhere because if I
lick my lips one more time oh it just makes
your lips dryer but anyway let me head out get

ah [Music] hello guys I'm back I was just unpacking
the stuff I got from the shop I went to
Lidl did a good shop there I think I spent
you know what my shopping wasn't even that big and
I spent 40 pounds but it's a lot less than
what like what it would have been if I'd gone
to I don't know like any other shop apart from
like Audi I just found like um Little's good value
for money and the food tastes good so that's where
I go to shop and it's not too far from
me so that's very good shop um now I'm hungry
so I'm gonna make dinner I'm really really trying to
stay away from the takeaways and you know what I
have to add up how much like parking was I've
had to because you saw me in my errands I
went to a few places today so we shall add
my parking to the screen of how much I paid
um I really just want to make some salmon I've
made the potatoes first I'm just gonna have potatoes roast
potatoes salmon green beans call it a day um yeah
and I have the rest for lunch tomorrow uh yeah
I'm so happy I got the main things I needed
to get done today oh what I believe for love
I love days like this when it's like super productive
got things I need to get out of the way
done um I just need to like tidy up put
some laundry away and yeah I'm gonna basically done for
the day so I just love black nails I just
love black nails of course you know like if you're
African you know like black nails is just absolutely wild
my parents hated even me getting a dark color like
a dark green no because it's like oh it's like
demonic devilish I don't know but like my thing is
I'll wear a whole black outfit black to back every
day nothing it's the nails that is too much it's
just so flattering so good on the skin it just
it just looks great yeah my mom's not gonna be
happy about this Addy's mom's not going to be happy
about this a lot of parents won't be unhappy about
this ah I'm sorry I just love it I tried
to go for a lighter color they didn't have it
and I was like you know I just don't want
to be fussy about colors give me black I liked
it once I like it again and it's just that
season short black nails Superior [Music] I see you [Music]
thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] guys it's
the next day ah let me bring you guys closer
let's figure out how much I spent yesterday um right
I think I'm pretty I've already done the calculations but
there was okay top to bottom let me get my
phone because I need to use my own bank transactions
yes so what did we do top to bottom first
things first I dropped some depop orders um that was
only like one pound fifty I think I just had
to pay like one pound for printing because I don't
have a printer at home so I'm just like I
should probably get one anyway depop and then I went
to go and get my nails done that was 30
pounds blue rip-off but I'm just so lazy no you
know what that's probably average price for like London London
I'm not traveling out I'm really not traveling out still
end up spending the same amount and then I went
to go to dry cleaners that was 88 oh then
I got um a lot latte as well as a
we've got latte and a pizza slice that was six
pounds parking for several places smear test was free uh
where else did I go after I went to my
laser appointment I've already paid that in bulk um I
paid 700 pounds in bulk earlier this year for 10
sessions which is actually quite good I think yeah it
was quite good for like legs um I get my
like navel underarms and Hollywood so yeah it's like 70
pound per session so food shop that was 40 pounds
petrol that was 49 well like pretty much 50 pounds
that makes a total of Bank you know what it's
not that bad well to be honest that's like an
average day of going out doing errands and getting things
checked off your list that's how much it's going to
be um yeah an average what I spend as an
average girl I'm not really an average am I and
that is how much I spent as a influencer living
in London on a day-to-day doing errands getting things done
