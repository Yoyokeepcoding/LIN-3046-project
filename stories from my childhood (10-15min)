swimming school {and} I was done {and} I never went
back there are not many coffee shops in my hometown
maybe three maybe maybe {but} there was one that stood
out on the weekends my dad used to take me
to this coffee shop to get me out of the
house {so} I wouldn't be loud {and} disruptive while my
mom was sleeping because my mom liked to sleep in
on the weekends {so} my dad {and} I would get
up early {and} head over to this coffee shop {and}
he would get a coffee {and} I would get a
maple scone oh the maple scone was <so> good good
I <really> used to look forward to going to this
Cafe I was a kid I didn't <really> know what
the vibe was {but} I still knew that the vibe
was good even though I was a kid {but} it
was <really> the maple scum like I <really> love the
maple scum I remember one day though my dad {and}
I show up as usual on a weekend to get
the maple scone {and} to get him a coffee {and}
I take a bite into the maple scone {and} it
has walnuts in it {and} it never had walnuts in
it before all of a sudden they decided that this
Maple scone needs to have walnuts in it {and} as
a a five or 6-year-old I was devastated but I
was not going to give up {so} {you know} what
I did I started picking the walnuts out of it
I would like break off a piece {and then} pick
out <all> the walnuts eat it it was a mess
{um} but now this coffee shop doesn't have the maple
scone anymore they kind of went corporate I spent <so>
much time at the park I was a park rat
like I would I run around at the park I'm
climbing around everything like I am it {was like} intense
I was making friends with random kids doing flips on
the jungle gym {yeah} it was it was intense it
was great {but} sometimes there weren't any other kids to
play with and my dad would have to play with
me and he would do it we' play hide-and seek
sometimes at night actually <too> I had a lot of
energy at night as a kid I was a night
owl for sure and my dad used to take me
to the playground to get <all> my energy out late
at night {and} we'd play hide-and-seek in the dark {and}
weirdly that's something I wouldn't <even> do as an adult
like that kind of scares me as an adult I
wouldn't do that as all kids do I loved sugar
as a kid I was also a <really> picky eater
so <all> I ate was pasta with butter {and} cheese
vegetarian chicken nuggets pizza {and} dessert that was it oh
and peanut butter a lot of peanut butter oh pancakes
any food where the main ingredient is flour I would
eat it that was <all> I ate sometimes as a
treat my dad would take me to this dut shop
{and} I would get two Donuts I'd get one one
chocolate glazed {and} one classic glazed {and} I would eat
both of them {and} then I would get <so> grumpy
there was something about sugar that made me grumpy {and}
my dad had to sort of draw the line with
me had to be {like} I don't know if you
can have two Donuts anymore cuz you get angry {like}
the sugar would I don't know I don't know I
don't know how to explain I don't <even> know why
this happened I would become aggressive it wasn't just with
the donuts though like my dad {and} I used to
make chocolate chip cookies all the time {but} we had
to stop making them them because I would eat them
{and then} get angry sugar makes me angry I guess
I would become <fully> aggressive {and} mean like evil {like}
I go in my room {and} {like} slam the door
{and} {like} start crying or something it was weird but
oh my God the donuts were <so> good I mean
<all> to be honest to me <all> Donuts are good
I <really> don't I'm not picky with the donut I'll
eat any donut it's a donut I'm eating it oh
my god oh it's even better than I remember it's
<so> good show <all> that sugar on the bottom it's
just soaked it's soaked with icing it's <so> good I
haven't had a donut in {like} years probably because when
I was a kid they made me evil I was
{just} going to say that {so} I'm going to be
<super> evil within the next hour or two probably I
loved the mall as a kid oh my God it
was my favorite place to hang out but it used
to be the hot spot in my hometown it was
{like} the only place where there was energy that's where
the energy was was that the mall it had some
phenomenal phenomenal stores it had a Hollister outlet <so> clutch
oh my God the clothing brand H was <so> trendy
hot {and} cool but it was a little pricey {and}
I was <so> lucky to have the Hollister outlet where
everything is like half off in my childhood Mall it
was amazing shut down now it's not there anymore there
was a hot topic I always wanted to be goth
{like} in my heart I felt goth {but} I never
<really> had the courage to do it on the outside
{you know} {but} I loved going into Hot Topic because
I wanted to be goth I always have had a
little goth streak {but} it's <never> <fully> come out I
