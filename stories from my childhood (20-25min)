good I haven't had it in years I think the
reason why I haven't gone back is because I'm scared
that they changed the recipe of the curry sauce or
they changed the recipe of the potatoes {and} I'm <so>
afraid of that that I don't want to go {and}
order it {and then} get disappointed wow that's good if
I <ever> open a restaurant which I won't {so} don't
worry I won't {but} if I <ever> did that would
be an appetizer I would have potatoes {like} crispy breakfast
potatoes with curry sauce on them oh my God what's
crazy is that this crepe restaurant was my favorite restaurant
{and} I <never> actually got a crepe there ever I
was afraid of them I was such a picky eater
you don't <even> know {like} because like C grapes were
<so> thin that it kind of grossed me out I
was like it's <too> thin don't ask it doesn't make
sense it doesn't make sense it doesn't have to make
sense it made sense to me as a kid speaking
of food another iconic food for me was the burrito
although it took me some time to get into the
burrito because when you look at a burrito from the
outside you don't know what's going on on the inside
every bite is {like} mystery you don't know what you're
going to get that <really> freaked me out for a
long time {but} my dad ate <so> many burritos {and}
{so} it was always around me and {So} eventually I
started taking little bites of my dad's burrito until it
got to a point where I realized this is a
food I {like} and H one of my go-to spots
was La cornetta I'd get a burrito with rice beans
cheese {and} that was it but then when I got
a little older I started adding avocado {but} the real
star is the green salsa oh the green salsa is
so fucking good I drench the damn thing in the
green salsa it's <so> fucking good we need more salsa
you want me to get you no high dollar cluster
what it eat it it's like the eighth wonder of
the world what a novelty life is just time in
between burrito facts when I was five my parents got
divorced and my mom moved to a town like 25
minutes away from my hometown and this town had a
different vibe it was much much less sleepy my mom
and I lived in this apartment for probably 10 years
and wow was it an experience was it an experience
<so> much happened at this apartment I was there for
middle school {and} for high school my mom decorated it
<so> nice on the inside she really made it homey
{and} cozy {and} don't get me wrong there are a
lot of fond {and} beautiful memories at this apartment there
are also some terrible memories let's be honest there are
some terrible memories {you know} number one the outside isn't
the <most> aesthetically pleasing listen it's not an architectural statement
okay it's not gorgeous now I realize how lucky I
am to have lived in such a safe cozy place
{but} as a kid I was an fucking and I
completely took it for granted and I was {kind of}
embarrassed of the way that my mom {and} I's apartment
looked which I'm not proud of like I feel terrible
about that I feel terrible about that I feel <so>
ungrateful I {feel like} an fucking but you know myself
consciousness wasn't <completely> unwarranted because there were a few occasions
where kids made fun of my mom and I's apartment
{but} {you know} what most of the time it was
behind my back I only found out about that a
few times and for the <most> part I never heard
it <so> it's <totally> fine it was probably happening more
than I even realized but again it was <totally> fine
{and} funny enough {like} kids made fun of my mom
{and} I's apartment because it you know didn't have a
proper lawn in the front {and} it was kind of
the paint was chipping {and} it was like kind of
smelled like weed all the time {like} it always smelled
like marijuana like cuz my downstairs neighbors were major weed
smokers it had its own little charm some kids had
some things to say about {but} once they gave it
a chance andthey hung out there they fell in love
with it they did all of my friends wanted to
hang out in my mom and I's apartment because it
was cozy {and} my mom {and} I were <so> welcoming
{and} loving {and} we always had good snacks {and} it
was fun like we lived super close to the downtown
area where <all> the restaurants
