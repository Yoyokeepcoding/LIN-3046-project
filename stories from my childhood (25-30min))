&a
were {and} stuff {like} that {and} so it was easy
to {just} walk downtown {you know} what it was a
total butt but to circle back on the downstairs neighbor
of it all yeah we had some issues with the
downstairs neighbor number one the building was not soundproof we
could hear everything our downstairs neighbors were doing {and} they
could hear everything we were doing like i would walk
across the living room {and} they would call the police
on my mom {and} I saying that I was stomping
{and} making an inappropriate amount of noise I'm not kidding
they would call the police that was disturbing {but} sometimes
they wouldn't go that far they wouldn't call the police
{and} instead they would take a broom {and} they would
start hitting the ceiling with the broom {and} they would
scream at me to shut up mind you I'm not
doing anything crazy I'm not {like} {like} {literally} <all> it
would take to get a noise complaint from them was
to walk across the living room {so} I got into
this habit of {just} walking around on my tippy toes
all the time {so} {so} I wouldn't anger the downstairs
neighbors {but} it was <so> unfair because it {was like}
okay you guys are calling the cops on us banging
on your ceiling yelling at us meanwhile you're smoking {like}
pounds {and} pounds of marijuana <every> single day {and} it's
coming up into my mom {and} I's apartment <so> our
apartment constantly smelled like weed constantly I was probably {like}
stoned my entire childhood because there was <so> much weed
{like} my it was terrible it that was a high
stress environment and as a result there was tension with
my mom and I {like} she was always high alert
high stress kind of upset {and then} that rubbed off
on me {and} I was always {kind of} high stressed
{but} I actually lived there up until I moved to
la {so} I lived there till I {was like} 16
{and} wow was I happy to leave wow was I
happy to leave and then my mom moved out a
few years later and wow was she happy to leave
my middle school is walking distance from my mom's apartment
{and} {you know} I was kind of bummed when I
went to to see it because they totally made it
fancy {like} it used to be {kind of} small {and}
cute {and} they ripped it apart {and} made it <all>
big {and} fancy {so} I was like {uh} {you know}
it {kind of} lost its meaning I remember I had
to make a choice I was either going to go
to middle school in the town where my dad lived
{or} in the town where my mom lived {and} it
was this tough decision {but} I remember i had a
dream once that I went to the middle school in
my mom's town and that's I made my decision I
woke up one day {and} I was like my dream
told me I have to go to this middle school
weird but I do wonder sometimes like how would my
life be different if I didn't go to that middle
school ooh I don't know I do not know <every>
single thing that happens in your life leads you to
where you are in the current moment {so} {it's like}
oh my god if I didn't go to that middle
school what would be different I was {so} excited for
middle school though I just wanted a locker i <really>
wanted a locker I wanted to decorate my locker <super>
cute {and then} I got there {and} I realized wow
this is actually hell on earth middle school is probably
the worst time in a kid's life there are a
few people who peak in middle school middle school is
terrible everybody's insecure {and} awkward {and} confused nobody has social
skills {yet} {so} everyone's {like} mean to each other {and}
mean to themselves {you know} nobody understands the weight of
their words it's a fucking mess everyone was wearing the
hollister abomi t-shirt the leggings {or} the skinny jeans with
the ug boots it was all it was all happening
it was vision I played that game I played that
game i wore the ugg boots i wore the leggings
I wore the skinny jeans I wore the hollister t-shirts
I did the whole thing I fit in I played
the game I <totally> played the game middle school was
the worst time of my life I was so insecure
I felt <so> bad about myself it was fun though
too it was fun it was emotionally turbulent but there
were fun memories like I think in middle school you
become a little bit more independent you can't drive yet
or anything but you do become a little a little
bit more independent your parents start letting you walk to
school by yourself your parents start to let you hang
out with your friends alone maybe at the mall maybe
in the downtown area {like} you {just} start to have
more freedom that's the good part of middle school after
middle school the kids whose parents were still at work
would go to the youth center myself included it was
like this community center that had a gymnasium it had
pool tables it had a little library area where you
could do homework it was a safe place for the
kids to hang out after school until their parents were
ready to pick them up or ready to let them
into the house {you know} I would go to the
youth center after school almost <every> single day {and} to
be honest I hated it {like} I would have rather
just gone home {but} {you know} my mom worked late
my dad worked late I didn't have a choice I'd
sometimes do my homework there {but} what I'd usually do
is hang out with the kids get into some trouble
we were allowed to come {and} go from the youth
center as we pleased we didn't have to stay there
we would leave and we would walk to the park
{or} we would walk to the you know local coffee
shop to the
