think it will come out at some point actually do
{you know} what no I don't think it will I
don't think it will I think those years are over
you never know though you never know there was a
bath {and} body works <all> the cool girls had a
Bath {and} Body Works hand sanitizer in their bag {and}
I had to keep up with the cool kids <so>
I'd go into the Bath {and} Body Works {and} get
a little hand sanitizer five bucks were they five bucks
that seems expensive Bath {and} Body Works hand sanitizers are
like a dream for parents because <all> <all> parents want
their kids to do is wash their hands it's {like}
please can you just wash your hands {and} kids never
want to wash their hands {but} Bath {and} Body Works
hand sanitizers were cool because they smelled good there was
like sugar cookie flavor {and} Peach Blossom flavor {and} {you
know} the packaging was <super> cute {and} they came in
<all> these cute colors {and} the kids wanted to collect
them what a dream come true that is for parents
because <all> the kids had these in their bags {and}
were using them left {and} right because they always wanted
their hands to smell like Bath {and} Body Works <so>
that's actually amazing phenomenal {and} admirable business model this mall
was home to the best hot dog restaurant there ever
was it was called fat dog {and} it's gone now
and I'm <so> sad I'm <so> sad cuz it was
<so> good oh it was <so> good {and} I was
a vegetarian growing up {and} they had vegetarian hot dogs
{and} they were <so> beyond delicious oh my God they
had a smoky flavor they were big like a lot
of vegetarian hot dogs that you get at the grocery
store are small the texture is {kind off} {and} they're
{just} not satisfying {but} this restaurant fat dog had the
most delicious large satisfying vegetarian hot dogs {and} I'd get
a vegetarian hot dog with a side of fries {and}
I would put <so> much mustard wo a lot of
mustard on the hot dog {and} I'd eat that hot
dog {and} I'd get all charged up {and} then I'd
either go shop around with my parents {or} I'd go
to a movie a memorable movie I saw was Coraline
favorite movie of all time one of my favorite movies
of all time I saw that in the theater probably
I don't know six times seven times I made my
dad take me to see it like three times and
I made my mom take me to see it {like}
five times I couldn't stop I also saw a Diary
of a Wimpy Kid at that movie theater {and} I
had a huge huge crush on the wimpy kid cuz
it was a live action Diary of a Wimpy Kid
{and} oh my God the actor in that was <so>
oh I had a huge crush on him looking back
I'm like wow am I I don't know like <so>
why but you know the Heart Wants What It Wants
I wanted the wimpy kid now I look back {and}
rodri from that movie was gorgeous <so> my Ty wow
<so> my type oh my God that's my type now
who big Epiphany when I got a little bit older
my friends {and} I would take the train to go
{and} hang out in other towns to be honest I'm
<really> impressed that we figured out how to buy a
train ticket {and} we figured out when to get off
{like} I I don't know how we did that there
was some sketchy moments on the train {like} one time
I was at one of the train stations {and} some
lady {just} started yelling at my friends {and} I I
don't remember why we were {like} screaming {and} crying I
don't remember it's very it's foggy I blocked it out
{but} that happened at one point one time I was
by the train station {and} some guy like had a
pair of like children's scissors {and} I had long blonde
hair at the time {like} my hair was dyed blonde
{and} he's like I'm going to cut a piece of
your hair off {and} he tried to cut a piece
of my hair off that was by the train station
{but} it was one of those things where it was
{like} okay if we don't take the train then we're
not going to get to go anywhere because there were
<so> many years where we relied on our parents to
drive us places {and} a lot of our parents were
working they couldn't just take us around town actually a
lot of my friends had stay-at-home moms {but} the moms
were <like> y'all I'm going to yoga I'm going to
my hot yoga class {and} then I'm going to go
cheat on on my husband with my dentist {or} something
{like} the they were busy okay sorry {so} when no
parent would come to the rescue we would take the
train my favorite restaurant as a kid was this restaurant
called crepe Vine {and} they had a bunch of Crepes
they had sweet crepes with Nutella and banana {and} ricotta
cheese {and} chocolate {and} caramel {and} stuff {like} that {and}
then they had Savory Crepes {like} crepes with mushrooms {and}
cheese {and} eggs {and} <all> these {you know} Crepes it
was a crepe restaurant {but} as {you know} I was
a picky eater as a kid {so} what I would
get from this restaurant was pasta penet pasta with butter
{and} parmesan cheese I got a little older though {and}
I started to Branch out {and} I started getting something
something weird okay I started getting something weird I would
order a plate of breakfast potatoes {like} home fries {like}
breakfast potatoes {and} then I'd get a side of curry
sauce sauce one time I tried their curry sauce I
think my mom ordered a crepe that came with a
side of curry sauce I tried it with a potato
once {and} I was like <holy> this is good and
so then I started ordering that when i' would go
there I'd get a massive plate of the potatoes and
I would just dip the potatoes in this curry sauce
oh the curry sauce is <so> good I haven't had
it in years I think
